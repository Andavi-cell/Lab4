# Building Height Calculator

## Background

The height of an object can be calculated using trigonometry. In this example, a person standing 150 ft. away from a building who’s height is 5’10” tall looks up to the top of a building at an angle of 57ᵒ. 
This forms a right triangle where the tangent of the angle is equal to the ratio of the opposite length over the adjacent length of the triangle. To find the height of the building, we need to add the length 
of the opposite side to the height of the person.

## Directions
After accepting the Lab4 assignment, clone your Lab4 repository to your virtual machine, add your solution code and test it against the correct results that match the interface prototype example shown below. 
Once any errors are corrected and the program is working correctly, push it back to your repositiry which will spin up a test of your solution code. Once it has passed the auto-test you will need to submit it 
to Canvas under the Lab4 assignment.

## Interface Prototype Example

### Test Case 1 Output
<pre><b>Enter your height in feet:5.8
Enter your distance from building (feet):150
Enter the angle of the line of sight:57
The height of the building is 237 feet tall.</b></pre>
### Test Case 2 Output
<pre><b>Enter your height in feet:5
Enter your distance from building (feet):42
Enter the angle of the line of sight:43
The height of the building is 44 feet tall.</b></pre>
