Complete the given template by creating the code that calculates 
the height of a building to the nearest integer when given the height 
of the person, distance from the building, and the angle from the 
line of sight to the top of the building. Note: the C++ tan function 
accepts the angle in radians, so your program will have to convert 
degrees to radians using the factor: radians = degrees * (Ï€/180)
